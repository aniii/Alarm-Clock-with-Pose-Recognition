# risefit - an Alarm Clock with Pose Recognition (iOS)
Problem: People who tend to miss alarms due to oversleeping or forgetfulness.

Solution: This iOS application, built with Swift and Objective-C, helps users wake up on time by combining a traditional alarm clock with a unique pose recognition feature.

Features:
- Standard alarm clock functionality (set time, ringtone, background)
- Customizable backgrounds with popular anime characters (Naruto & Goku)
- Voice note ringtone option
- Innovative pose recognition system:
    - Alarm rings twice within a minute.
    - Users perform a displayed yoga pose to silence the second alarm.
    - Posenet algorithm captures user joints and a logistic regression model predicts the pose.
    - Correct pose recognition successfully silences the alarm.

Technical Achievements:
- Integration of alarm clock functionalities.
- Implementation of Posenet for real-time pose estimation.
- Development of a logistic regression model for pose prediction.

Target Users:
- Individuals prone to oversleeping or forgetting alarms.
- Users seeking a more engaging and interactive wake-up experience.

Overall, this project demonstrates the development of a novel alarm clock application that leverages pose recognition technology to promote a more active and mindful wake-up routine.
